        As Team Lead, I oversee feature requirements with the product team,
        explaining technical possibilities. I estimate development times and
        provide updates at standup meetings. I ensure timely feature delivery,
        manage team schedules, and offer guidance for uninterrupted development.
        I collaborate on API structures with the backend team and review and
        approve pull requests. After QA approval, I handle staging and
        production environment setups and manage defects during sprints.

        In our Scrum methodology, tasks are initiated through ticket creation on
        the Azure board by our Team Lead. Once tasks are assigned, I begin
        execution, consulting the Functional Specification Document (FSD) and
        Figma designs as needed. Collaboration with backend developers is
        critical as we integrate REST API endpoints into our project. Upon task
        completion, I initiate a Git pull request for peer review and approval.
        If QA identifies bugs within my module, I take ownership by assigning
        myself the ticket for defect resolution. I promptly address issues,
        ensuring fixes progress seamlessly through both development and QA
        phases concurrently.

        At our small-scale company, we leverage the Kanban methodology for
        project management. My role involves receiving client requirements and
        collaborating with backend developers and my lead to plan the
        development process, ensuring alignment before initiating UI
        development. I prioritize optimization and the creation of reusable
        components for scalability and efficiency during code development.
        Working closely with backend developers, I integrate API endpoints
        seamlessly into our React project using Axios for efficient
        communication. Upon completing development tasks, I handle deploying the
        React application across various hosting platforms such as AWS, Netlify,
        and Vercel to ensure accessibility and functionality
